0,"My computer does not turn on, what do I do now?","
*First check the computer's power cord to make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket. If you are using a plug strip, make sure it is completely plugged into the wall socket and that the power switch on the plug strip is turned on. Some plug strips also have a built in circuit breaker which usually looks like a black or red button near the power switch. Press the button to reset it and see if that solves the problem.",generalFAQ,0
1,What do I do when my computer crashes?,"
*There are many reasons why a computer may just stop working or ""freeze"". Most of the time there isn't much we can do about it, it is a fact of life that computer programs have become so complex that occasionally users will experience problems even when performing common tasks. When your computer no longer responds to keyboard commands your best bet is to restart the computer.",generalFAQ,0
2,What do I do if my hard disk fails to work?,"
*As with most computer errors, your first step is to shut down your computer and restart it. This will help you determine whether or not you actually have a hard disk problem. If the disk is severely damaged then your computer will probably fail to restart properly. If this is the case then contact MCWare IT Solutions, this is a job for the professionals.",generalFAQ,0
3,"There is no display on the monitor, what do I do now?","
*Make sure the monitor is on. If no power light (green or orange light) is seen on the monitor display try pressing the power button until it comes on. If your computer monitor was on and you stepped away from the computer and upon returning it was black, it's likely that the computer is asleep. Try moving your mouse, clicking the mouse buttons, and/or pressing any key (space bar) on the keyboard to wake it up. Make sure that the monitor is connected properly to the back of the computer.",generalFAQ,0
4,What do I do if the image on screen is distorted or skewed?,"
*You may receive a distorted image when the cable is loose or defective. Disconnect the video cable going from the back of the computer and verify that no pins are bent, burnt or broken. Once verified re-connect the monitor cable. If the refresh rate is not properly set the monitor may have a wavy or an appearance that lines are going down or across the monitor slowly or fast, this may also cause a flickering affect. A distorted image can be caused by magnetic or other types of interference. Verify no speakers, fans or other magnetic devices are close to the monitor.",generalFAQ,0
5,"I get a 'no signal input' message, what do I do?","
*Verify that the monitor is properly connected in the back of the monitor as well as to the back of the computer. If the monitor appears to be connected properly, verify that a cable is not loose by disconnecting all cables that can be disconnected in the back of the monitor (generally the data cable cannot be disconnected). Next, disconnect the data cable connected to the back of the computer and then reconnect the cable. When connecting the cable in the back of the computer ensure the cable connection is tight. Most Computers will also have screw ends that can be screwed in to hold the connector in place.",generalFAQ,0
6,"There are black borders on my screen, what do I do?","*If the resolution was recently changed it is possible for the monitor to not auto adjust or shift to the correct size. If this occurs, the resolution can be changed back to the original setting or you can manually adjust the monitor. If a black border exists on the monitor it can generally be resolved by manually adjusting the horizontal or vertical width. Because each monitor is different, the method of adjusting this setting will vary; consult your monitor documentation.",generalFAQ,0
7,Why is my mouse acting erratically?,"
*Users who have an optical mechanical mouse (most common mouse for desktop computers) are likely experiencing erratic behaviour because the mouse is not clean or is dirty. If you've cleaned the mouse and continue to encounter issues and this mouse has worked in the past fine unfortunately your mouse is likely defective. One additional test that can be done to help determine if this is the case or not is to connect the mouse to another computer. Otherwise we suggest replacing the mouse.",generalFAQ,0
8,"The wheel on my mouse isn't working properly, what do I do?","
*If you're running any version of Microsoft Windows and are encountering issues with the mouse wheel, first attempt to adjust the mouse settings through the Mouse Properties window. This window can be accessed by opening the Control Panel and double-clicking the Mouse icon.",generalFAQ,0

13,Is it safe to turn off a Windows computer without doing a shut down?,"
*Users should not simply press the power button or restart the computer while Windows is still running unless there is an issue with the computer.

In fact many versions of Microsoft Windows will check the computer for any problems if the computer is not shut down properly.",generalFAQ,0

16,I can't receive any email attachments?,"
*If the e-mail box is full of other e-mail messages, and/or your storage space is only a few megabytes, it's possible that the attachment being sent cannot be received. Often if this problem is occurring the person sending the e-mail should get a response back from your e-mail server indicating that your mailbox is full and/or has exceeded its allocated size. Because computer viruses and other malware are best distributed through e-mail, many e-mail service providers, companies, and e-mail programs prevent certain types of file extensions from being distributed or received through e-mail. For example, Microsoft Outlook protect its users by automatically disabling certain file extension types from being received in e-mail.",generalFAQ,0
17,Are spaces allowed in email addresses?,"
*Just like an Internet URL no spaces are allowed in an e-mail address. However, names can be broken up using a period; for example, John Smith may have an e-mail address: john.smith@example.com or john.s@example.com because no spaces are allowed in the e-mail address.",generalFAQ,0
18,My printer is printing smudged/distorted pages?,"
*When printing on untraditional paper your printer may experience smudges, un-even or crooked text, and/or text that runs off the edges of the paper. Your printer may be printing fuzzy, blurry, and/or other faint text because of dirty print heads. All modern printers have some type of printer cleaning, self-test, and/or diagnose mode that can be performed to check and clean the printers print heads and other internal equipment used to print.",generalFAQ,0
19,How do I fix a paper jam?,"

Turn the printer back on.",generalFAQ,0
20,"I lost my printer installation disk, how can I install my printer?","
*Thankfully a missing printer installation disk or disc is not the end of the world and will not require you to wait until a new diskette or CD can be sent to you. Today all printer and other hardware manufacturers are providing downloads on the Internet to their software programs and drivers that are included with their products.",generalFAQ,0
21,I can't connect to my network drive anymore?,"
*Verify that the network cable is properly connected to the back of the computer. In addition, when checking the connection of the network cable, ensure that the LED's on the network are properly illuminated. For example, a network card with a solid green LED or light usually indicates that the card is either connected or receiving a signal. Note: generally, when the green light is flashing, this is an indication of data being sent or received.",generalFAQ,0
22,How do I map a network drive?,"
*Open Microsoft Explorer. From Explorer, click the Tools drop down menu and click the option ""Map Network Drive."" Specify the network drive or network computer as the folder.

You may be asked to confirm if you want to end the unresponsive program, so choose Yes. Do this for all programs that are not responding.

*Check the brightness & contrast levels of the monitor via the menu button, to make sure it has not been set too dark.
*Move the mouse and press any key on the keyboard to make sure the screensaver hasn't activated or that the computer hasn't gone into standby/hibernation mode.",generalFAQ,0

0,PC Won't Boot Into Windows,"
*Try Safe Mode First
When your PC just won't boot into Windows at all, you'll probably want to start off with Safe Modeuse the F8 key right when the system starts up to access the menu and see if Windows will boot into Safe Mode. If you're able to get into Windows, the problem is likely something that would load only when you boot normallygraphics card drivers, junk applications, or perhaps some spyware applications.
*Even Safe Mode Doesn't Work
If you can't even get into Safe Mode, you should , which can be accessed from the Advanced options in the Safe Mode menu; you can pull out your system repair disc, or your Windows installation disc and use the Repair option. If you're having a , you can use the command prompt from an installation CD and use the bootrec /fixboot command.",generalFAQ,0
1,PC Crashing or Blue Screening,"
*If you're using Windows 7 or later and you're getting a blue screen of death, chances are very high that the problem is either driver or hardware relatedcontrary to legend, Windows just doesn't crash like that very much unless the problem is tied to hardware somehow.
*Once you've identified the driver causing the problem, try and head into Safe Mode and uninstall or upgrade the driver causing the problemsometimes the driver won't be visible, so you'll need to . If you're doing a bunch of work in Safe Mode, sometimes it's helpful to  without using the F8 key every time.
*No Luck? Recover Files and Reinstall
If you simply can't get anything else to work and you don't have a full backup, your best bet is to , and then start the process of reinstalling Windows again. If you're using the native Windows backup tools, you can , or .",generalFAQ,0
2,PC Is Running Slowly,"
*Check Task Manager
The first thing that every geek is going to do when a computer is running slowly is open up Task Manager, or  (if you've already got it installed) to see what process is taking up the most CPU or memorythat's generally the culprit. While you're in there, it's a good idea to look for other resource-wasting apps that we can kill.
*Uninstall Crapware
Now that we've killed the application that's currently killing the CPU, it's time to start getting rid of applications that we don't need. You can use Revo Uninstaller and the  to clean up applications without leaving extra traces.
*Clean Up the PC
Cleaning up your PC is really quite easy. You can start by running Disk Cleanup, but if you really want to get the job done, grab yourself a copy of CCleaner and run through a cleaning session. While you're at it, you can  to keep the PC clean on a regular basis.
*Scan for Viruses and Spyware
It's a good idea to run a system scan when your PC is running slower than normal and you've already determined that it's not a runaway application. We think .
*Use the Reliability Monitor
This under-utilized tool is an  and figure out what might have caused your system problemsit will show you a full history of system crashes, application problems, and even Windows Updates, so you can track down what changed on your system right before your system started running slow. Just type in reliability into the Start Menu search box, and you'll be able to see everything, and even drill down into specific errors to see more details.
*Use the Advanced Tools in Windows 7
Windows 7 has quite a number of , but they're buried in Control Panel where you might not think to look. Just head to Performance Information and Tools > Advanced tools and you'll see a list of performance issues along with suggested fixes for the problems.
*Trim Down Startup Apps to Speed Up Boot Times
This applies both when your PC takes forever to boot and when you've got a glut of applications running away in your system tray that you don't need; it's time to trim down your startup applications. You can use the built-in MS Config utility or any number of tweaking applications, but you might want to , which not only helps you disable startup applications, but it shows you exactly which ones are affecting your boot times the most.",generalFAQ,0
3,Internet Is Slow or Not Loading,"
*Pull Out the Ping Command
If you're having problems connecting to the internet, you should first make sure that you are really connectedmost of the time you can pull out a command prompt (hit the Windows key, type cmd, hit Enter) and type in a ping command like ping yahoo.com to see if you're getting any response.
*Disable and Re-Enable Your Connection
If you're not getting a response, you can try disabling and re-enabling your wireless connection, which solves more problems than it really should. If that doesn't work, use the Windows network troubleshooter by right-clicking your wireless icon, and follow through the steps. Windows will disable and re-enable the adapter again, and wipe the DNS caches as well. If you're still having problems, there's a good chance your internet connection is just down.
*Slow Response Times
Sometimes the problem isn't connecting to the internet, but slow response times while you're browsingor maybe your browser is simply hanging. If you're using Internet Explorer, you can ; if you're using Firefox you can  or just .
*Web Site Not Loading
If the problem is a specific web site not loading, you can check  to see if you're the only one having the issue with the web siteor you can often do a quick search on Twitter to see if other people are complaining as well.",generalFAQ,0
4,Windows Explorer Is Hanging,"
*If you're having problems loading up Windows Explorer and browsing your file system, the problem is almost always a shell extension that shouldn't be installed, or some shell extensions that are conflicting with each other. For example, the shell extensions for Dropbox and TortoiseSVN tend to cause problems when you put your code into your Dropbox folder, causing hanging and generally slow file browsing.",generalFAQ,0
